## Description
This is a quick project that mimics some design elements of Google's Material Design. I wanted to play with the box-shadow property and CSS Z-index.

This also gave me a chance to continue practicing writing Sass. I used Sass variables for colors and box-shadows and Sass nesting.  

### Technologies Used
- Sass (SCSS)
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome
